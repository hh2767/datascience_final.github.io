#Background

[Plasticizers](https://www.plasticisers.org/), mainly phthalates, can [interrupt endocrine system](https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.93101378) even if at very low level of exposure, and there is evidence of [plasticizers depositing in animal brain](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.498.4170&rep=rep1&type=pdf).  [Concerns](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389417304570?via%3Dihub) have been rising in pediatricians and scientists. Obesity, [which is a major public health problem](https://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/overweight/en/) across the world, is also associated with plasticizer exposure. First fat and now sugar have been blamed for causing obesity, while increasing evidence shows that [plasticizer pollution is also playing an important role](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/aarhus/pdf/35/Annex_11_report_from_Lowell_Center.pdf). However, effects of plasticizers on bodyweight within different age and gender groups are different. With more detailed exposure monitoring data of plasticizer exposure available at [NHANES datasets](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm), we can now explore the relationship between body weight and plasticizer exposure.

#Data source

All data was retrieved from the the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. 

In the study, we uesd demographics data ([DEMO2011-2012][1], [DEMO2013-2014][2] and [DEMO2015-2016][3]), phthalates metabolites data ([PHTHTE2011-2012][4], [PHTHTE2013-2014][5] and [PHTHTE2015-2016][6]) and body measures data ([BMX2011-2012][7], [BMX2013-2014][8] and [BMX2015-2016][9]).

#Analysis and results

###Phthalate exposure comparison
Phthalate exists in human body in different types. In the original dataset, eight types of phthalates in participants' urine were recorded. Therefore, we analyzed percent contribution of each type of phthalate to the sum-total phthalate and [visualized it](percentage.html). Then, we made some [plots](distribution.html) to compare phthalate exposure in different subgroups of people.


###Assessing phthalate-obesity relationship
First, we made some [plots](relationship.html) and perceived association between phthalate exposure body mass index. We also noticed that the effects of phthalate exposure on BMI are defferent between different age and gender groups.

Then, we fitted general linear model to analyze the relationship. The result is recorded in the following table. It shows odds of obesity changes associated with unit phthalate exposure change in each age and gender group, and their 95% percent confidence intervals.

group    |female           |male             
---------|-----------------|----------------
adult    |1.18(1.09, 1.29) |1.11(1.02, 1.2)  
children |1(0.89, 1.11)    |1.15(1.02, 1.29) 

Among adults, for a one-unit increase in the sum-total phthalate exposure, we expect to see about 18% and 11% increase in the odds of being overweight/obese for females and males, respectively, adjusting for age, race and poverty status. 

Among children, there is no association between phthalate and obesity in females statistically. While in males, for a one-unit increase in the sum-total phthalate exposure, we expect to see about 15% increase in the odds of being overweight/obese, adjusting for age, race and poverty status.
