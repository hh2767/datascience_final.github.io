#Background

[Plasticizers](https://www.plasticisers.org/), mainly phthalates, can [interrupt endocrine system](https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.93101378) even if at very low level of exposure, and there is evidence of [plasticizers depositing in animal brain](http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.498.4170&rep=rep1&type=pdf).  [Concerns](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304389417304570?via%3Dihub) have been rising in pediatricians and scientists. Obesity, [which is a major public health problem](https://www.who.int/gho/ncd/risk_factors/overweight/en/) across the world, is also associated with plasticizer exposure. First fat and now sugar have been blamed for causing obesity, though, increasing evidence shows that [plasticizer pollution is playing an important role](http://ec.europa.eu/environment/aarhus/pdf/35/Annex_11_report_from_Lowell_Center.pdf). However, effects of plasticizers on bodyweight of different age and gender groups of people are different. With more detailed exposure monitoring data of plasticizer exposure available at [NHANES datasets](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm), we can explore the relationship between body weight and plasticizer exposure.

#Data source

All data was retrieved from the the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm). The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nutritional status of adults and children in the United States. 

In the study, we uesd demographics data ([DEMO2011-2012][1], [DEMO2013-2014][2] and [DEMO2015-2016][3]), phthalates metabolites data ([PHTHTE2011-2012][4], [PHTHTE2013-2014][5] and [PHTHTE2015-2016][6]) and body measures data ([BMX2011-2012][7], [BMX2013-2014][8] and [BMX2015-2016][9]).
