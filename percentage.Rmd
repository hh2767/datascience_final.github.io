Levels of eight types of phthalate in participants' urine were recorded. These phthalates are: MEP, MnBP, MiBP, MCPP, MBzP, MEHP, MEHHP, MEHHP. Details of these phthalates can be found [here](https://wwwn.cdc.gov/Nchs/Nhanes/2011-2012/PHTHTE_G.htm). The barplots below show percent contribution of each type of phthalate to the sum-total phthalate exposure among different subgroups.

The plots show that mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP) contributed most to the sum-total exposure. And percent contribution patterns are different between different gender and age groups.
